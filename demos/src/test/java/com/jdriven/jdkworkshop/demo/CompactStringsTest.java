/**
 * Before Java 9, Strings were always internally stored in UTF-16 format. This means that every character
 * requires 2 bytes to be stored in memory.
 *
 * However, statistically, most Strings can be stored using only LATIN-1 encoded characters, which take up
 * only 1 byte per character. Because the JVM internally stores a lot of Strings in memory, potentially
 * a lot of memory can be saved by using 1 byte per character instead of 2, where possible.
 *
 * Since Java 9, the JVM will use 'compact' Strings where possible. When creating a String, the JVM
 * checks whether or not every character in the String can be represented in LATIN-1, and if so,
 * stores the String in 'compact' format (1 byte per character). Otherwise, the original UTF-16 format
 * is used (2 bytes per character). Because Strings are immutable, the format used for storage doesn't have
 * to change after String creation.
 *
 * In the class below we demonstrate the effect. Read the code in the unit test and run it, check the console output,
 * trying to understand what is shown.
